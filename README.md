# CS 255 - System Analysis and Design

## Project Overview

DriverPass is a driver training company that identified a gap in the market: students frequently fail DMV driving tests due to inadequate preparation resources. This project involved designing a comprehensive web-based system to address that problem through online coursework, practice testing, and on-the-road training session scheduling.

The work simulates a real-world consulting engagement—gathering requirements from client stakeholders, producing formal documentation, modeling the system with UML, and presenting the proposed solution.

## Real-World Application

System analysis and design sits at the intersection of business and technology. Organizations depend on analysts who can listen to stakeholders, identify underlying needs, and translate those needs into specifications that development teams can implement. Miscommunication at this stage leads to costly rework, missed deadlines, and systems that fail to solve the actual problem.

This project mirrors the workflow found in professional environments: interpreting interview transcripts, distinguishing functional from nonfunctional requirements, producing diagrams that communicate system behavior to both technical and non-technical audiences, and documenting constraints and assumptions that inform downstream decisions.

## Competencies Demonstrated

- **Requirements Engineering** — Eliciting, analyzing, and documenting business and technical requirements from stakeholder input
- **UML Modeling** — Creating use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams to represent system structure and behavior
- **Technical Communication** — Writing documentation for mixed audiences and presenting complex systems in accessible terms
- **Systems Thinking** — Considering how users, processes, data, and external integrations interact within a larger architecture

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
